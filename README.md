### 🌸 Iris Dataset Classifier  
**Multi-model classification on classic dataset**  
[🔗 GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Moustafa00/Iris-Dataset-Analysis)  
Compare and visualize classification models to predict iris flower species. Implements Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVM, and more — with performance analysis and visuals.

🔧 Tech: `Scikit-learn`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `SVM`, `Naive Bayes`, `LDA`, `KNN`

---

### 🔄 ETL Pipeline
**Simple, Dockerized ETL Workflow**  
[🔗 GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Moustafa00/data-pipeline)  
Build a clean ETL pipeline using Pandas inside a Docker container. Reads a CSV, applies data cleaning (nulls, column renaming), and outputs a processed file. Containerized for portability and dev/test repeatability.

🔧 Tech: `Python`, `Pandas`, `Docker`, `docker-compose`, `ETL`

## 🚀 Why This Hub Exists
This isn’t just a repo collection. It’s a visible log of effort, improvement, and curiosity. I’m not aiming to look like a genius — I’m aiming to **understand, build, and grow**.  
That’s what this space is for.

Let’s keep going.
